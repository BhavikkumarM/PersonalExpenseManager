# PersonalExpenseManager


**Expense Tracker**  
I built this intuitive and sleek expense management app using Java and Swing to make tracking my income and expenses super easy. It features real-time data entry, dynamic breakdowns for income and expenses, and displays totals directly in-app. With a stylish color palette, detailed category handling, and plans for adding charts and recurring payments, this project helps me stay on top of my finances. Perfect for personal budgeting or small-scale financial management!
